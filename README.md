# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system suggests movies to users based on the features of movies they have interacted with or shown interest in. The project is built using Python and various libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `streamlit` for the user interface. This is a content-based movie recommender system which is implemented using scikit learn based on the "Bag of Words (BoW)" algorithm which is one of the simplest and interpretable algorithms.


## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: Provides movie recommendations based on movie content and user preferences.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization.
- **Data Handling**: Efficient handling and processing of large datasets related to movies.
